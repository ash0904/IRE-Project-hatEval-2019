## Introduction
Hate Speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristic such as race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other characteristics. Given the huge amount of user-generated contents on the Web, and in particular on social media, the problem of detecting, and therefore possibly limit the Hate Speech diffusion, is becoming fundamental, for instance for fighting against misogyny and xenophobia.

The proposed task consists of Hate Speech detection in Twitter but featured by two specific different targets, immigrants and women.

The task was articulated around two related subtasks for each of the involved languages: a basic task about Hate Speech, and another one where fine-grained features of hateful contents will be investigated in order to understand how existing approaches may deal with the identification of especially dangerous forms of hate, i.e. those where the incitement is against an individual rather than against a group of people, and where an aggressive behaviour of the author can be identified as a prominent feature of the expression of hate.
